<s> the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon petrovich executive vice president of headline news cnn 's sister network </s>
<s> but that wo n't be easy </s>
<s> networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change </s>
<s> it also takes money that cnn has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see </s>
<s> and the cable-tv operators cnn 's distributors and part owners like things just the way they are </s>
<s> the repositioning bid is aimed at cnn 's unsteady viewership and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive </s>

<s> its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service </s>
<s> it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks </s>
<s> it filled its daily schedule with newscasts called daybreak daywatch newsday and newsnight but the shows varied little in content personality or look </s>
<s> now the push is on for more-distinctive shows </s>
<s> our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul amos cnn executive vice president for programming </s>

<s> or so it must seem to jackie mason the veteran jewish comedian appearing in a new abc sitcom airing on tuesday nights N p.m. edt </s>

<s> here in neutral language is the gist of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign parted company </s>
<s> mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates uncritically </s>
<s> he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates uncritically </s>
<s> he said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa </s>
<s> of course mr. mason did not use neutral language </s>
<s> as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the borscht belt live television and the nightclub circuit mr. mason instinctively reached for the vernacular </s>
<s> he said jews were sick with complexes and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy shvartze with a mustache </s>
<s> if mr. mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new yorkers would the water be quite so hot </s>
<s> it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language </s>
<s> in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism </s>
<s> for example the new york state counsel for the naacp said that mr. mason is like a dinosaur </s>
<s> people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck </s>
<s> these critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group such as polish jokes and the type that is double-edged aiming inward as well as outward </s>
<s> the latter typically is the humor of the underdog and it was perfected by both blacks and jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves </s>
<s> in the hands of a zealot like lenny bruce this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons </s>
<s> but wielded by a pro like jackie mason it is a constructive form of mischief </s>
<s> why constructive </s>
<s> because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing they are similar in one respect both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict </s>
<s> that 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police on college campuses and elsewhere taboo all critical mention of group differences </s>
<s> as elizabeth kristol wrote in the new york times just before the mason donnybrook perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer </s>
<s> the question is if group conflicts still exist as undeniably they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe then what other means do we have for letting off steam </s>
<s> do n't say the tv sitcom because that happens to be a genre that in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy </s>
<s> it is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer yuppies vs. blue-collar bostonians in cheers children vs. adults in the cosby show </s>
<s> but these are not the differences that make headlines </s>
<s> in chicken soup mr. mason plays jackie a jewish bachelor courting maddie lynn redgrave an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother rita karin and her brother michael brandon maggart </s>
<s> it 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants </s>
<s> at least they both speak with strong accents as do jackie and maddie </s>
<s> it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old recipe </s>
<s> and a safe one imagine if the romance in question were between an orthodox jew and a member of the nation of islam </s>
<s> back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of abie 's irish rose made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of jewish and irish immigrants so popular that its author anne nichols lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain </s>
<s> and it has remained there as evidenced by its reappearance in a N cbs sitcom called bridget loves bernie whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of meredith baxter and david birney </s>
<s> clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will boil over but whether it will simmer at all </s>
<s> so far the bubbles have been few and far between </s>
<s> part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms ever since the didactic days of norman lear to preach about social issues </s>
<s> to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them </s>
<s> for instance michael dislikes jackie not because he 's a shrewd jewish businessman but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker </s>
<s> even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and mr. mason 's comic persona </s>
<s> the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself </s>
<s> but too often these routines lack spark because this sitcom like all sitcoms is timid about confronting mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences </s>
<s> i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the catholic-jewish dispute over the carmelite convent at auschwitz </s>
<s> that issue like racial tensions in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can simmer </s>
<s> but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about caring for other people that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of miss america </s>

<s> moody 's investors service inc. said it downgraded its rating to b-2 from ba-3 on less than $ N million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes </s>
<s> the rating concern said franklin 's troubled diversification record in the securities business was one reason for the downgrade citing the troubles at its l.f. rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries </s>
<s> they perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these said franklin president duane h. hall </s>
<s> i think it was a little premature on their part </s>
<s> just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves </s>
<s> does this signal another black monday is coming </s>
<s> or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like oct. N N eventually turned out to be </s>
<s> here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action what happens next and what investors should do </s>
<s> joseph granville </s>
<s> i 'm the only one who said there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr. granville once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer </s>
<s> everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says </s>
<s> well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same </s>
<s> if you 're a technician you obey the signals </s>
<s> right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out </s>
<s> i see no major support until N </s>
<s> i see a possibility of going to N this month </s>
<s> mr. granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit 52-week lows about N stocks hit new lows friday </s>
<s> most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like </s>
<s> elaine garzarelli </s>
<s> a quantitative analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash </s>
<s> friday 's big drop she says was not a crash </s>
<s> this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N </s>
<s> now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive </s>
<s> so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained </s>
<s> those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says </s>
<s> this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned </s>
<s> thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a fluke </s>
<s> my advice is to buy </s>
<s> as she calculates it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings </s>
<s> she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value </s>
<s> ned davis </s>
<s> friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says mr. davis president of ned davis research inc </s>
<s> but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no 1987-style crash </s>
<s> there was a unique combination in N he says </s>
<s> margin debt was at a record high </s>
<s> there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds </s>
<s> the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses </s>
<s> a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it </s>
<s> in N such selling contributed to a snowball effect </s>
<s> today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading </s>
<s> over the next several months though he says things look bad </s>
<s> i think the market will be heading down into november he says </s>
<s> we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again </s>
<s> sort of a two-step bear market </s>
<s> he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year </s>
<s> that would be a normal bear market he says </s>
<s> i guess that 's my forecast </s>
<s> leon g. cooperman </s>
<s> i do n't think the market is going through another october '87 </s>
<s> i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. cooperman a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management </s>
<s> mr. cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush </s>
<s> i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability </s>
<s> he ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago </s>
<s> unlike N interest rates have been falling this year </s>
<s> unlike N the dollar has been strong </s>
<s> and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating </s>
<s> but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says </s>
<s> so it 's a very mixed bag </s>
<s> thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks </s>
<s> if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying </s>
<s> but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients </s>
<s> we 're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked friday </s>
<s> john kenneth galbraith </s>
<s> this is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity says mr. galbraith an economist </s>
<s> i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says </s>
<s> the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity </s>
<s> this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable </s>
<s> nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely </s>
<s> there is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose he says </s>
<s> it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the thirties much as the financial community and the government may try </s>
<s> mario gabelli </s>
<s> new york money manager mario gabelli an expert at spotting takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone </s>
<s> companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says </s>
<s> examples are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting </s>
<s> these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. gabelli figures they will continue </s>
<s> the market was up N N since president bush took office mr. gabelli says so a correction was to be expected </s>
<s> he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was nibbling at selected stocks during friday 's plunge </s>
<s> stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says </s>
<s> jim rogers </s>
<s> it seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon says mr. rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund </s>
<s> he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession </s>
<s> friday you could n't sell dollars he says </s>
<s> dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade </s>
<s> if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to inflationary pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much </s>
<s> mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go </s>
<s> he recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness </s>
<s> frank curzio </s>
<s> many people now claim to have predicted the N crash </s>
<s> queens newsletter writer francis x. curzio actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month </s>
<s> mr. curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board </s>
<s> if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down </s>
<s> if not we could go to N very soon </s>
<s> frank w. terrizzi </s>
<s> stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. terrizzi president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati </s>
<s> renaissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally </s>
<s> renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills </s>
<s> t-bills probably are the right place to be he says </s>
<s> regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom lantos chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging </s>
<s> N that your sept. N editorial kangaroo committees was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading </s>
<s> i thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative </s>
<s> N that mr. lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment </s>
<s> yes he did </s>
<s> as i watched him on c-span i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings </s>
<s> he did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the constitution </s>
<s> he used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights </s>
<s> unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the fifth </s>
<s> he sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary </s>
<s> as your editorial rightly pointed out samuel pierce former hud secretary and lance wilson mr. pierce 's former aide are currently being held up to scorn for taking the fifth amendment </s>
<s> that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. lantos </s>
<s> N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud </s>
<s> my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc </s>
<s> absolute rubbish </s>
<s> by any reasonable man criterion mr. lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted </s>
<s> apparently their verdict is in </s>
<s> right now they 're pursuing evidence </s>
<s> that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice </s>
<s> how was that practice referred to when i was in school </s>
<s> ah yes something called a star chamber </s>
<s> of course mr. lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change </s>
<s> no doubt that 's partially true </s>
<s> everything that mr. lantos says in his letter is partially true </s>
<s> he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials </s>
<s> but if his explanation of motivation is true why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity </s>
<s> why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency </s>
<s> such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost </s>
<s> no mr. lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash </s>
<s> N that the journal defends the sleaze fraud waste embezzlement influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while mr. pierce was secretary of hud etc. and so forth </s>
<s> no to my mind the journal did not defend sleaze fraud waste embezzlement influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust </s>
<s> it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense </s>
<s> the problem which the journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. lantos who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body </s>
<s> of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective </s>
<s> the system is the problem not an individual member </s>
<s> individuals can always have their hands slapped </s>
<s> it 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble </s>
<s> i do not by any means defend hud management </s>
<s> but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency and yes maybe criminality within hud could possibly generate </s>
<s> the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when tail gunner joe mccarthy did his work </s>
<s> raymond weber </s>
<s> parsippany n.j </s>
<s> i disagree with the statement by mr. lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former hud officials who assert their fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings </s>
<s> the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself </s>
<s> this privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify </s>
<s> thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth </s>
<s> the privilege however has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only </s>
<s> the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause </s>
<s> baxter v. palmingiano N u.s. N N </s>
<s> thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter </s>
<s> he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution </s>
<s> allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution </s>
<s> absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify </s>
<s> thus when mr. pierce asserted the fifth in a noncriminal proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a good-faith justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution </s>
<s> the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with mr. pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime </s>
<s> drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the fifth amendment shield against self-incrimination </s>
<s> clark s. spalsbury jr </s>
<s> estes park colo </s>
<s> it was friday the 13th and the stock market plummeted nearly N points </s>
<s> just a coincidence </s>
<s> or is triskaidekaphobia fear of the number N justified </s>
<s> in academia a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors </s>
<s> robert kolb and ricardo rodriguez professors of finance at the university of miami found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th </s>
<s> but their study which spanned the N period has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data </s>
<s> in the '70s the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the you-know-what </s>
<s> but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to yale hirsch a collector of stock market lore </s>
<s> another study found that the N fridays the 13th in the N period had higher than average returns higher even than fridays in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices </s>
<s> on the only other friday the 13th this year the dow jones industrial average rose about four points </s>
<s> professor kolb says the original study titled friday the 13th part vii was published tongue-in-cheek </s>
<s> in a similar vein he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity </s>
<s> reminiscent of those during the N crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered </s>
<s> we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice president of otc trading at robinson-humphrey co. in atlanta </s>
<s> it was like the friday before black monday two years ago </s>
<s> whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges </s>
<s> nonetheless the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever diving N or N N to N </s>
<s> ten points of the drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading </s>
<s> by comparison the new york stock exchange composite tumbled N N friday and the american stock exchange composite fell N N </s>
<s> on oct. N N the nasdaq composite fell N points or N N followed by its devastating 46.12-point or N N slide three days later </s>
<s> nasdaq volume friday totaled N million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year </s>
<s> the single-day record of N million shares was set on oct. N </s>
<s> there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said e.e. buzzy geduld president of herzog heine geduld a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues </s>
<s> most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors </s>
<s> mr. king of robinson-humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades </s>
<s> the subject is a sore one for nasdaq and its market-making companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash </s>
<s> peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton declared it was the last hour of trading on a friday </s>
<s> there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots </s>
<s> it was n't intentional we were all busy </s>
<s> james tarantino head of otc trading at hambrecht & quist in san francisco said it was just like two years ago </s>
<s> everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time </s>
<s> jeremiah mullins the otc trading chief at dean witter reynolds in new york said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading </s>
<s> but he added you can only take one call at a time </s>
<s> market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur </s>
<s> on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to </s>
<s> when selling is so frenzied prices fall steeply and fast </s>
<s> two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories market makers themselves began dumping shares exacerbating the slide in otc stock prices </s>
<s> on friday some market makers were selling again traders said </s>
<s> but with profits sagging on wall street since the crash companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand </s>
<s> mr. tarantino of hambrecht & quist said some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares </s>
<s> everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid he said </s>
<s> so while otc companies incurred losses on friday trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in N </s>
<s> two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit </s>
<s> i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said mr. king of robinson-humphrey </s>
<s> tony cecin head of equity trading at piper jaffray & hopwood in minneapolis said that piper jaffray actually made money on friday </s>
<s> it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said </s>
<s> joseph hardiman president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency </s>
<s> the pace of trading was orderly he said </s>
<s> nasdaq 's small order execution system worked beautifully as did the automated system for larger trades according to mr. hardiman </s>
<s> nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence </s>
<s> in the past the otc market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation </s>
<s> because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels traders and otc market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent </s>
<s> but they are worried </s>
<s> we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back lamented mr. mullins of dean witter </s>
<s> more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the otc market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the october N crash </s>
<s> mr. cecin of piper jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears </s>
<s> it wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says </s>
<s> the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc market big and small institutional investors as well as individual investors and market makers </s>
<s> but grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from N shares to N shares compared with blocks of N shares or more two years ago </s>
<s> shearson 's mr. dapuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to bargain-hunt </s>
<s> institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter were calmer </s>
<s> we had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic mr. dapuzzo said </s>
<s> if they could n't sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf </s>
<s> in addition he said some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some otc stocks whose prices were beaten down </s>
<s> in addition mr. dapuzzo said computer-guided program selling of otc stocks in the russell index of N small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500-stock index sent occasional waves through the market </s>
<s> nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered </s>
<s> the nasdaq N index of the largest nonfinancial issues including the big otc technology issues tumbled N N or N to N </s>
<s> the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped N N or N to N </s>
<s> the otc market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks </s>
<s> but they fell sharply </s>
<s> mccaw cellular communications for instance has offered to buy lin broadcasting as well as metromedia 's new york city cellular telephone interests and in a separate transaction sell certain mccaw properties to contel cellular </s>
<s> mccaw lost N N or N N to N </s>

<s> consider this </s>
<s> by N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law </s>
<s> the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill </s>
<s> we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon panetta d. calif said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press </s>
<s> for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy </s>
<s> the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been resisting </s>
<s> one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence kudlow a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week </s>
<s> the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers </s>
<s> last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by klm royal dutch airlines </s>
<s> but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision </s>
<s> and he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc </s>
<s> some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop </s>
<s> in many ways the backdrop to friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of october N 's 508-point crash </s>
<s> then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold </s>
<s> the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve </s>
<s> and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the tax-writing house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous </s>
<s> the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period </s>
<s> but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year </s>
<s> lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan which still is n't fully implemented </s>
<s> one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble </s>
<s> everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of N that we were looking at a recession rep. panetta said yesterday in an interview </s>
<s> that did not happen </s>
<s> they learned they could survive it without much problem </s>
<s> but administration officials privately agree with mr. panetta who said a precipitous drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy </s>
<s> in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around </s>
<s> there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen d. texas </s>
<s> nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight </s>
<s> hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation </s>
<s> there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation </s>
<s> during last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds </s>

<s> when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member of the tax-writing senate finance committee hailed it </s>

<s> friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest </s>
<s> senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit </s>
<s> the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen. warren rudman r. n.h said yesterday </s>

<s> no one in washington was willing to take the blame for provoking friday 's drop in the stock market </s>
<s> but some players were quick to seize the moment </s>
<s> before the sun had set on friday richard rahn the supply-side chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains </s>

<s> it 's huge </s>
<s> consider the growth of portables which now comprise N N of all personal computer sales </s>
<s> laptops generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year </s>

<s> making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory </s>
<s> it also has precluded use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines </s>

<s> the competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times </s>

<s> if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost </s>
<s> elements of the left are also reflexively opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the regimentation of youth or want to see rights enlarged not obligations </s>
<s> but what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology </s>
<s> how should we think about national service </s>
<s> let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning </s>
<s> would service be voluntary or compulsory </s>
<s> short or long </s>
<s> part-time or full-time </s>
<s> paid or unpaid </s>
<s> would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands </s>
<s> what kinds of work would they do </s>
<s> what does national mean </s>
<s> would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations </s>
<s> and who would serve </s>
<s> only males as with the draft or both sexes </s>
<s> youth only or all ages </s>
<s> middle-class people or poor people or a genuine cross-section </s>
<s> many or few </s>
<s> those are not trivial questions and the label national service answers none of them </s>
<s> then how should we think about national service </s>
<s> as a starting point here are five propositions N consider the ingredients not the name </s>
<s> ignore national service in the abstract consider specific proposals </s>
<s> they will differ in crucial ways </s>
<s> N service should be service </s>
<s> as commonly understood service implies sacrifice </s>
<s> it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career </s>
<s> it follows that proposals like nunn-mccurdy whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ N a year do not qualify </s>
<s> there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a gi bill without the gi arguably those benefits should be earned not given </s>
<s> but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs </s>
<s> why call that service </s>
<s> N encouragement is fine compulsion is not </s>
<s> compelled service is unconstitutional </s>
<s> it is also unwise and unenforceable </s>
<s> who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year </s>
<s> but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior </s>
<s> it should also encourage service preferably by all classes and all ages </s>
<s> its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing </s>
<s> N good programs are not cheap </s>
<s> enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply forest fires fought housing rehabilitated students tutored day-care centers staffed </s>
<s> there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well but not cheaply </s>
<s> good service programs require recruitment screening training and supervision all of high quality </s>
<s> they involve stipends to participants </s>
<s> full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale </s>
<s> non-residential programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year </s>
<s> are they worth that </s>
<s> evaluations suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted </s>
<s> but the calculations are challengeable </s>
<s> N underclass youth are a special concern </s>
<s> are such expenditures worthwhile then </s>
<s> yes if targeted </s>
<s> people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost </s>
<s> they can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers </s>
<s> underclass youth do n't have those opportunities </s>
<s> they are not enrolled in high school or college </s>
<s> they are unlikely to be employed </s>
<s> and they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects </s>
<s> but many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service </s>
<s> some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons </s>
<s> but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed </s>
<s> learning skills producing something cooperatively feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them </s>
<s> even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation </s>
<s> strictly speaking these youth are not performing service </s>
<s> they are giving up no income deferring no careers incurring no risk </s>
<s> but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future </s>
<s> that is a service to the nation </s>
<s> it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve </s>

<s> the fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled sunday morning when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories quoting a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning </s>

<s> and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month </s>
<s> an hour before friday 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut </s>

<s> for those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored in view of greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government there is but one bright sign the scandals still encircling former prime minister andreas papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass </s>
<s> in the mid-june round of voting greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party </s>
<s> the ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was in essence little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation on one side the center-right new democracy party headed by constantine mitsotakis </s>
<s> on the other the so-called coalition of the left and progress a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-soviet communist party of greece and its euro-communist cousin the hellenic left </s>
<s> the unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain pasok mr. papandreou 's party as common political enemy </s>
<s> the ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption purportedly at all levels but the main marks were mr. papandreou and his closest associates </s>
<s> in point of fact this catharsis was overdue by decades </s>
<s> when reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges however the notion transmogrified into a promised assault with targets primarily for political gains not justice </s>
<s> with regard to greece 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal mr. papandreou 's principal accuser remains george koskotas former owner of the bank of crete and self-confessed embezzler now residing in a jail cell in salem mass. from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to greece </s>
<s> mr. koskotas 's credibility is at best problematic </s>
<s> he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points </s>
<s> nevertheless the new democracy and communist parties herald his assertions as proof of pasok complicity </s>
<s> among unanswered questions are whether mr. papandreou received $ N million of stolen bank of crete funds and an additional $ N in bribes as contended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in mr. koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest and what pasok 's cut was from the $ N million mr. koskotas pinched </s>
<s> two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the koskotas affair that pasok members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court </s>
<s> but eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas mr. koskotas funneled into new democracy coffers </s>
<s> in the end the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and indications that point to pasok not clinching proof </s>
<s> on another issue greeks were told how their national intelligence agency the eyp regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and pasok cabinet members </s>
<s> despite convincing arguments it was never established that mr. papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps </s>
<s> the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks </s>
<s> the coalition government tried to show that pasok ministers had received hefty sums for oking the purchase of f-16 fighting falcon and mirage N combat aircraft produced by the u.s.based general dynamics corp. and france 's avions marcel dassault respectively </s>
<s> naturally neither general dynamics nor dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid or not to various greek officials for services rendered </s>
<s> so it seems that mr. mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served mr. papandreou a moral victory on a platter pasok whether guilty or not can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at mr. papandreou 's expense </s>
<s> but while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help pasok regain power mr. papandreou should never be underestimated </s>
<s> first came his predictable fusillade he charged the coalition of the left and progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting pasok and thwarting the course of socialism in greece </s>
<s> then to buttress his credibility with the left he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the pasok banner </s>
<s> next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth by bringing into pasok a well-respected communist party candidate </s>
<s> for balance and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of mr. mitsotakis </s>
<s> thus pasok heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench but also with seals of approval from representatives of its harshest accusers </s>
<s> crucial as these elections are for greece pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle </s>
<s> the country 's future nato participation remains unsure for instance </s>
<s> greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the N targets of heightened common market cooperation </s>
<s> greece 's bilateral relations with the u.s. need attention soon as well </s>
<s> for one the current accord concerning u.s. military bases in greece lapses in may N </s>
<s> negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the june elections but the clock is running </s>
<s> another matter of concern is the extradition of mohammed rashid a palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the u.s. for the N bombing of a pan american airways flight </s>
<s> the greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the rashid case but the matter awaits final approval from greece 's next justice minister </s>
<s> the greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism </s>
<s> that pasok could win the elections outright is improbable the greek press previously eager to palm off pasok 's line has turned on mr. papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance </s>
<s> yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real </s>
<s> if mr. papandreou becomes the major opposition leader he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition </s>
<s> also he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in march </s>
<s> new democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against pasok forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles </s>
<s> as for mr. papandreou </s>

<s> fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy </s>
<s> hence nbc might be able to take say a N N stake in a company such as mgm\/ua </s>
<s> if the transaction raised objections the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake </s>

<s> walter sisulu and the african national congress came home yesterday </s>

<s> at the same time six anc colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in N and sentenced to life imprisonment were reunited with their families at various places around the country </s>
<s> and as the graying men returned to their homes the anc outlawed in south africa since N and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships </s>
<s> a huge anc flag with black green and gold stripes was hoisted over the rickety gate at mr. sisulu 's modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts caps and scarves </s>
<s> at the small four-room home of elias motsoaledi a leading anc unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing umkhonto we sizwe well-wishers stuck little anc flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in anc ribbons </s>
<s> i am happy to see the spirit of the people said mr. sisulu looking dapper in a new gray suit </s>
<s> as the crowd outside his home shouted anc anc the old man shot his fists into the air </s>
<s> i 'm inspired by the mood of the people </s>
<s> under the laws of the land the anc remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in lusaka zambia </s>
<s> but the unconditional release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the anc is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing </s>
<s> the government can never put the anc back into the bottle again said cassim saloojee a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome mr. sisulu </s>

<s> but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country </s>
<s> as other repressive governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control </s>
<s> as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of mr. mandela as well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency </s>
<s> if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the anc the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest </s>
<s> if it does the large number of right-wing whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands </s>
<s> the newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure </s>
<s> the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence if it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. mandela behind bars </s>
<s> pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government </s>
<s> in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment </s>
<s> in order to head off any divisions mr. mandela in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in lusaka as soon as possible </s>
