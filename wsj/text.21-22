<s> national geographic the sixth-largest u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love </s>
<s> so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half </s>
<s> to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times </s>
<s> despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women </s>
<s> worse it lagged behind competitors in offering now-standard gimmicks from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers </s>
<s> but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign </s>
<s> advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan mccraw who joined in april as national advertising director </s>
<s> what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance </s>
<s> people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't </s>
<s> the 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before </s>
<s> it largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the height of their consuming years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate </s>
<s> the magazine had its best year yet in N when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N </s>
<s> but this year when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest </s>
<s> the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market </s>
<s> perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a four-color page vs. $ N for the smithsonian a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation </s>
<s> when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all </s>
<s> even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like smithsonian the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc </s>
<s> to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets </s>
<s> but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors </s>
<s> time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups </s>

<s> the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders </s>

<s> the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange </s>
<s> while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations </s>
<s> critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders </s>
<s> traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders </s>
<s> the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand </s>
<s> the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration </s>
<s> the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions </s>
<s> the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them </s>
<s> wendy gramm the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by thanksgiving </s>
<s> the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said </s>
<s> whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact </s>
<s> currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as socalled locals </s>
<s> the tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. gramm told the senate panel </s>

<s> investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either </s>

<s> the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor </s>
<s> but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock </s>
<s> the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling </s>
<s> if you look at N years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management </s>
<s> a dollar invested in the stock market in N would have grown to $ N by the end of last june according to laurence siegel managing director at ibbotson associates inc </s>

<s> the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market </s>
<s> over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio </s>
<s> for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is N N to N N over a 10-year period compared with N N over three years and N N over one year </s>
<s> if you do n't need the money for N years there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says </s>
<s> stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john blankenship jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners </s>
<s> stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says </s>
<s> there are some important caveats before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say </s>
<s> individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living </s>
<s> people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses </s>
<s> you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. blankenship a del mar calif. financial planner </s>
<s> but once the basics are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ N says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc </s>
<s> he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds </s>
<s> despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments </s>
<s> it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for wedbush morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm </s>
<s> our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros </s>
<s> individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market </s>
<s> the cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but N N of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund </s>
<s> and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains </s>
<s> that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says </s>
<s> after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing </s>
<s> it 's very tough for most individuals to out-trade the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper </s>
<s> you should really think twice if you think you can out-smart the system </s>
<s> then too many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market </s>
<s> so what 's the best way to buy stocks </s>
<s> unless an individual has a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper </s>
<s> still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights he adds </s>
<s> george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to medium-size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional stomping ground for small investors </s>
<s> this growth sector which usually carries a price\/earnings multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's N happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now </s>
<s> it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas </s>
<s> moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term </s>
<s> many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area he notes </s>
<s> we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says </s>
<s> the pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad </s>
<s> they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes </s>
<s> friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says carmine grigoli chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp </s>
<s> buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says </s>
<s> in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks </s>
<s> in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down </s>
<s> that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out </s>
<s> when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says </s>

<s> hard on the heels of friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine </s>
<s> their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market as individual investors did in droves after the crash in october </s>
<s> just days after the N crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors </s>
<s> this time around they 're moving even faster </s>
<s> painewebber inc. filmed a new television commercial at N p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night </s>
<s> fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today </s>
<s> shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads </s>
<s> it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday </s>
<s> other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were plotting out potential new ad strategies </s>
<s> the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic </s>
<s> this time the firms were ready </s>
<s> fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge </s>
<s> when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers </s>
<s> the ads touted fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline fidelity is ready for your call </s>
<s> a fidelity spokesman says the 800-line which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend </s>
<s> a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says </s>
<s> to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial </s>
<s> it would have been too late to think about on friday </s>
<s> we had to think about it ahead of time </s>
<s> today 's fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity </s>
<s> underneath the headline diversification it counsels based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility </s>
<s> it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name </s>
<s> painewebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the N crash </s>

<s> it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which cnn would agree to air its last-minute creations </s>
<s> the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists sounding particularly bullish </s>
<s> taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. farrell advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle </s>
<s> we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation </s>
<s> the spot was scheduled to appear three times on cnn last night </s>
<s> painewebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks </s>
<s> instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market </s>

<s> the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example </s>

<s> in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N </s>
<s> but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective </s>

<s> morever much of the damage was accomplished by a 's who had some catching up to do </s>
<s> in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the a 's catcher terry steinbach </s>
<s> he hit a N pitch from rick reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from N to a decisive N where it stayed </s>
<s> so what if steinbach had struck just seven home runs in N regular-season games and batted in the seventh position of the a 's lineup </s>

<s> that he was the a 's winningest pitcher during its american league campaign with a N mark plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving that might not be this week </s>
<s> the same goes for mike moore another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in sunday 's contest </s>
<s> every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before marveled giant manager roger craig </s>
<s> he 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat </s>

<s> the stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs N of N that took N series leads went on to win it all </s>
<s> that 's not an average to soothe giant rooters </s>
<s> one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart that 's a better name for a public conveyance than desire do n't you think would have been ecstatic over the proceedings but they observe them in relative calm </s>
<s> partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of oakland coliseum and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition hostilities advanced no further at least as far as i could see </s>
<s> a few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams </s>
<s> i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday </s>
<s> i love 'em both </s>
<s> the only thing i 'm rooting for is for the series to go seven games said david williams a sacramento septuagenarian at the coliseum before sunday 's go </s>
<s> the above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility </s>
<s> i choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from somewhere else </s>
<s> suffice it to say that if this were a new york yankees-mets series or one between the chicago cubs and white sox hey it 's possible you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets </s>
<s> anyway the a 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for </s>
<s> in the opening game besides steinbach and stewart there was walt weiss a twiggy-looking second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery </s>
<s> he was flawless afield ditto in game two moved a runner along in the a 's three-run second inning and homered for his team 's final tally </s>
<s> such is his reputation among the east bay bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph </s>
<s> not his autograph power-hitter mcgwire 's </s>
<s> an a 's co-hero of the second game was rickey henderson who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation </s>
<s> he smoked toronto in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in N at bats and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate sunday along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run </s>

<s> the cold guys in the set were will clark kevin mitchell and matt williams the giants ' N hitters </s>
<s> they combined for N hits six home runs and N runs batted in in the five games against the cubs </s>
<s> they went a collective 5-for-24 here with zero homers and ribbies </s>
<s> it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come </s>
<s> i believe in the law of averages declared san francisco batting coach dusty baker after game two </s>
<s> i 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold </s>

<s> it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition </s>

<s> the arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily </s>
<s> if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington </s>
